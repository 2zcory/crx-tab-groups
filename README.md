# Chrome Extension Tab Group Management

A Chrome Extension for managing tab groups efficiently, built with Vite, React, and Manifest V3.

## Features

- **Group Management**: Organize your tabs into named and colored groups.
- **Sync Storage**: Persists your group configurations across devices using Chrome Sync Storage.
- **Migration System**: Robust data migration system to handle schema updates seamlessly.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and responsive user interface built with React.

## Project Structure

The source code is located in the `src` directory:

- **`sidepanel/`**: Contains the main UI logic for the extension's side panel.
- **`background/`**: Service worker scripts handling background tasks.
- **`migrations/`**: Data schema migration logic. [Read more](./src/migrations/README.md).
- **`storage/`**: Wrappers for Chrome Storage API interactions.
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks.

## Installing

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 14) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```shell
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Configuration**: Check `src/manifest.ts` if you want to customize the extension metadata.

## Developing

pnpm dev
```

### Loading in Chrome

2. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `dist` (or `build`) folder generated by the build process.

### Debugging
